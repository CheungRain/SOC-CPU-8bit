2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
LUTAR-1#1 Warning
LUT drives async reset alert  
LUT cell ac_i_2, with 2 or more inputs, drives asynchronous preset/clear pin(s) ac_reg/CLR, cy_reg/CLR, ov_reg/CLR, zn_reg/CLR. The LUT may glitch and trigger an unexpected reset, even if it is a properly timed path.
Related violations: <none>

LUTAR-1#2 Warning
LUT drives async reset alert  
LUT cell ans[7]_i_2, with 2 or more inputs, drives asynchronous preset/clear pin(s) ans_reg[0]/CLR, ans_reg[1]/CLR, ans_reg[2]/CLR, ans_reg[3]/CLR, ans_reg[4]/CLR, ans_reg[5]/CLR, ans_reg[6]/CLR, ans_reg[7]/CLR. The LUT may glitch and trigger an unexpected reset, even if it is a properly timed path.
Related violations: <none>
